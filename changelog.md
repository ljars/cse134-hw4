Improvements

- My site now has a toggleable dark mode that persists between page reloads. It is toggled down at the bottom of the page. It uses localStorage to store the user's selection. I think my site looks nice in both themes (should be enough contrast).

- I fixed the input field placeholder text color in the Contact Me page because it was hard to read.

- I updated the filler content on the 'About Me' to reflect my actual work experience. The About Me page has my basic CV information now.

- I also added that I was valedictorian at my high school in the education section, so that there is some more education information.

- I enabled Google Analytics on my site. This should allow me to see various details about how users are engaging with my site, to give me information about how to optimize the presentation.

- I made some small changes to my main stylesheet (style.css) to make it look better with the styled CRUD and the 'contact me' page.
